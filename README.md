There are many techniques to spin spider silk, the easiest of which is wet spinning, in which the spidroins are dissolved in a chemical solution before entering a coagulation bath that removes the solvent and causes conformational changes [5, 7]. There are many combinations of solvents and coagulation baths, such as concentrated aqueous solution in saturated ammonium, hexafluoroisopropanol in methanol, hexafluoroacetone hydrate in methanol, and formic acid in methanol [7].

To do wet spinning, a microsyringe pump will be used. The microsyringe pump is capable of extruding the dope at speeds as slow as 1 μL/min into a coagulation bath. Once the spidroins have coagulated, a post-spinning roller will collect the spider silk.

Because of the microsyringe pump’s design, shear force will help in the coagulation process of the spidroins [5, 7, 8]. Moreover, once the spidroins and gold nanoparticles are in the syringe the oxygen will be purged with Nitrogen gas to increase the chances of binding the gold nanoparticles and spidroins together.
